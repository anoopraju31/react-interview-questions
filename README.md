# React Interview Questions 
- A List of React Interview Questions and their answers. 

## Questions

1. **What is React and how can you best describe it?**
   - React is a JavaScript Library for building User Interface.
        
2. **What is JSX?**
   - JSX stands for JavaScript XML
   - JSX is simply a syntax extension of JavaScript.
   - JSX looks similar to HTML, it returns JavaScript Object which when rendered generates HTML.
   - JSX was developed to make developer experience easier.
   - Earlier we used function createElement() for React to create a template, which returns React Elements, an object representation of a DOM node. This Becomes really hard to track by developers as it gets nested inside one another.
   - Both JS Engine and Browser does not  understand JSX directly, it needs to be transpiled (converting one code to another code) before reaching the JS Engine.
